# React CSS Module Starter project

Purpose of this project is to learn how to setup a simple ES6+ web project with React, CSS modules, and a good dev experience (HMR, hot-reload)

Sure we can eject a `create-react-app` project, but the configuration might be too daunting.


# TODO
- add Typescript support?
- rambda.js?
